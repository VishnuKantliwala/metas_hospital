It has its presence established in Surat city since 1923. It started as a humble dispensary at Udhna with the basic amenities for healthcare. Now, as we enter the centennial decade, and look back on its rich history and odyssey, one can afrmatively echo that the hospital has evolved from a Primary Healthcare facility to the city's most preferred Super Specialty Hospital. Having a wide spectrum of super-specialty disciplines, round-theclock doctors, state-of-the-art facilities, the hospital is a one-stop destination for availing treatment from simple discomfort to complex life-saving surgeries and procedures. </p>
                                <p class="blog_text" align="justify"> I am proud that the hospital is accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH). It is an assurance of quality in the care given by the healthcare fraternity.  </p>
